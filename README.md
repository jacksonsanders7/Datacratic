# Datacratic-
# DataCommons

DataCommons is a collective personal data cooperative that enables individuals to
pool, govern, and monetize their data democratically.

## Problem
Individuals generate valuable data, but platforms extract and monetize it without
collective consent or fair compensation.

## Solution
DataCommons introduces a cooperative model where:
- Individuals retain ownership of their data
- Data is pooled only with explicit consent
- Members vote on how pooled data is used
- Revenue is distributed transparently

## Core Principles
- Collective governance
- Privacy-by-design
- Non-extractive data economics

## Architecture Overview
- FastAPI backend
- PostgreSQL data store
- Consent and governance logic at the core
